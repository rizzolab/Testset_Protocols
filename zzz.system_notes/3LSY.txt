antechamber creates bond orders which it later rejects on cofactor (issue for NAD in general)
bonds (54 55) and (54 67) in 001.lig-prep/cof.am1bcc.mol2 were changed to both be aromatic

P.3 atomtype had to be manually assigned to cofactor because amber converts to C.3 (see dat/antechamber/ATOMTYPE_CHECK.TAB)
