It would be nice if run.002 was modified so the minimized ligand, receptor and complex rmsd are printed out to a file rather than to the screen, this way we would have it for record keeping. Or you can pipe the srun slurm sscripts into unique output files for each process but srun in tcsh is wonky enough. 

No more tcsh. Convert all scripts to bash

If there was a warning printed when non standard residue was converted

We should have a single master log and a single list of errors for each system. Then all system with crucial inspection go into a master list

NAD from antechamber is then rejected in prep file creation in antechamber

1A7A is removed for MSE nonstandard residue

#Notes on newer systems
1R9O is missing a heme

in run.002 add a ">" to the pipe cof.ori.mol2 

run.006 <0 is only a discrepency in one direction. FIX THIS to fit anything != 0
in run.006 not all ions are HETATM -_- 
   see 1AID 1J07

SPREADSHEET hasFALSE CARBON hits WITH CL  in ligand formula

*!*!*!* mol2.py in zzz.scripts on github  doesnt create correct bond counts when writing multigrid mol2

MAKE SURE U UPDATE WITH THE CORRECT IN 2023_04/zzz.scripts which is now correct but not pushed

Why isnt Y2P working anymore? investigate this -2GQG 3F5P

REMOVE 1A8I because covalent cofactor "LLP" near ligand in active site

3LSY cofactor needs to be fixed - has 2 unprotonated hydroxyls and formal charge shoudl be -1

Make sure all zzz.master from updated FARMA makes to this zzz.master
