This set of scripts should be preserved on the github.

If a new set of scripts is created, it should be separate and with a new version number.

The tutorials associated with this set of scripts are located at: https://ringo.ams.stonybrook.edu/index.php/Benchmarking_Lab_SOPs under Test_Set_Construction

Choose the tutorial version number which matches the set of scripts used.

NOTE:
While Testset construction and Benchmarking tutorials are on same page on wiki, these repositories are deliberately kept separate, as it is not always necessary to run both testset construction in pair with Benchmarking
